title: Mid-pandemic L.A. trip
summary: I am in L.A. for the fourth time since we moved to Washington almost five years ago. That almost averages out to one visit a year. A lot has changed if you pay attention, but at the same time it feels so familiar as if I haven't been gone.

I am in L.A. for the fourth time since we moved to Washington almost five years ago. That almost averages out to one visit a year. A lot has changed if you pay attention, but at the same time it feels so familiar as if I haven't been gone. 

After settling mom into the AirBnB where we are staying, I stood in the doorway listening to the sounds of the neighborhood. I could hear the hum and rumble of the tires from cars speeding by on the freeway only half a mile away. And from a nearby house the blaring sound of a speaker that is loud enough to hear it, but unsure of the direction. I can't make out the song, but the polka pattern tells me that it's a Mexican norte√±a. Across the street from where we are staying are three Mexican ladies talking over each other. They are  not arguing. That's just how Mexican ladies gossip. The children are laughing and chasing each other in the yard. Their laughter gets briefly interrupted by the chopping helcopter overhead. 

It's late afternoon and the sun is setting over the downtown skyline. In the east side where I am staying only the deeper orange rays can still be felt trying to warm the evening, but failing miserably because  night is almost here. Its beginning to smell like carne asada from all the street taco carts and food trucks that don't seem to be phased by a pandemic. 

I love this city. I love east L.A., but at the same time I hate almost everything about it. I hate having to drive back and forth the same two blocks waiting for someone to leave so you can take their parking spot. I hate the traffic, and more than the traffic, I hate that drivers don't stop to ask if everything is ok when you are stopped with your hazard lights on. They block intersections and cut you off. And if you use your turn signals to change lanes, they speed up to block you instead of slowing down and let you by. I hate how dense the city is. You get use to it, but you are always somewhere. In L.A. you can't ever be in the middle of nowhere, and to an introvert sometimes nowhere is a healing place.

*In fifth grade (before I even understood English) this was my favorite song. The song came in the radio on my drive to the AirBnB where we are staying. Hearing it just added to the nostalgia I was already feeling.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
