## Change

I can’t tell if I have become a better person. I don’t feel any closer to a ‘better-version’ of myself that I constantly wrote about three years ago. I actually feel farther away.

|   Before 	|  Now 	|
|---	|---	|
|   I am a fair, and open minded Christian.	|   I am critical of christianity, and being around large christian groups puts me on edge.	|
|   Friendship(s) are some of the purest type of relationships. I don’t have a lot of friends, instead I have a few close friendships.	|   I am generally apprehensive about friendship(s) in general. I don’t make an effort to build friendships.	|
|   I am playful. 	|   I am not playful.	|
|   I joke with coworkers, and join in silliness.  	|   I don’t joke with coworkers.	|
|   I listen to 2 - 3 hours of music a day.  	|   I listen to music 10 - 12 hours a day.	|
|   I go to bed at midnight at best, mostly at 1am or 2am.	|   I go to bed at least 3 hours before midnight.	|
|   I have to plan ‘marty-time’—that is, time to be alone.	|   I spend about three times as much time alone as I did before.	|
|   I don’t talk much, but I usually have an opinion about what is being discussed.	|   I don’t talk much outside of work	|
|   I like thinking about how my wife and I are a good example of two people who love each other. 	|   It is continuously present before me, that my wife believes that I am a jerk/asshole.	|
|   I don’t worry about much. I believe things will generally work out.	|   I worry a lot.	|
|   People talk about anxiety attacks, but I don’t know what they are.	|   I have an anxiety attack about once a week.	|
|   I go through phases where I just feel sad. It lasts a few days and then I’m ok.	|   I feel sad almost always.	|
|   I don’t chant.	|   I chant daily.	|
|   I don’t meditate.	|  I meditate daily.	|
|   I don’t think about what comes after I am gone, I am preoccupied with what’s immediately next.	|   I think about death a lot. Not about dying, but about what will I be remembered for when I die. It is a thought constantly on my mind, and what I use to make choices (or regret the ones I make). 	|
|   I am angry at my sister, and we don’t really talk.	|   I am kinder to my sister.	|
|   I am not as patient with mom, but I try to be kind to her. 	|   I am less kind to mom.	|
