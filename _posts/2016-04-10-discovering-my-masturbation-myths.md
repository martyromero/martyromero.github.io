## Something to Hide

I remember the summer when I discovered masturbation. It was a wonderful three months that came to an end in September at the start of a new school year. I recall vividly the anxiety I felt over not being able to enjoy quiet mornings romancing myself while mom and my sister were at work. I must have been eleven or twelve and at that age I hadn't even heard the term "masturbation" and if I had, I wouldn't have been able to associate it with this beautifully raw gesture that left me numb with joy when I was finished.

I grew up in a household that was NOT sex-friendly. By that I mean that sex was never talked about. We ignored the sexy scenes in R rated movies and pretended that we didn't understand the inuendos of TV commercials. I was never taught that sex or masturbation was a bad thing, but I picked it up. I learned—like we all do—to NOT talk about it and to hide my natural curiosity about it.

## My Story

It didn't help that I was brough up a Mormon by a wonderful Mexican single mother. [Mormonism teaches implicity and explicity that masturbation is not only wrong, but also sinful](http://www.mormonthink.com/QUOTES/masturbation.htm "LDS Quotes on the Topic of Masturbation"). I grew up listening to the leaders of the Mormon Church say things like :

>...If you are tempted to masturbate, think of having to bathe in a tub of worms, and eat several of them as you do the act.

About a year after I discovered that I could .... the bishop of my local Mormon congregation took it upon himself to gather all the young men twelve to fifteen years old, and graphically describe what masturbation was and how it made young boys "evil". He described something very different from my experiences. Yet here was the chosen man of God telling me that what I was doing was a "sexual sin" and that sexual sins ranked right next to murder in the eyes of God. To me, my penis and the pleasure that I derived during my quiet mornings at home were special.

The sad thing about this experience was how it changed me. I was listening to a the words of a man whom I had been taught was Jesus Christs' mouthpiece tell me that I was "evil" and that I was commiting a sin second in greviousness only to murder. Some of my very first lies **must** have been to myself. I don't actually remember convincing myself that what *I* was doing was *NOT* so "evil" and "sinful". But I must have.

Looking back, I wish someone would have assured me that:

- The LDS Church leaders were wrong.
- That like anything, masturbation could become an unhealthy behavior, but that it is neither a sin nor evil.
- That being highly sexual and sensitive was not something that I needed to hide.

I am forty-two years old now and I am married to a wonderful woman. We don't have a perfect marriage and much of what is wrong has been my own doing. I am just now beginning to understand how damaging it was for me to not have a space where I could be open about sex. And by that I don't mean that I wish I would have been more promiscuous or sexual.

What I wish, is that my mother and Church leaders would have sat in the crowd of this  beautifully raw TED talk.
