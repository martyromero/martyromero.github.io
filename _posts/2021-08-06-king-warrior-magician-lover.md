title: King, Warrior, Magician, Lover - My Thoughts
summary: I miss believing in something so deeply that thinking about it causes me to fall on knees. Since stepping away from the Mormon church I have become suspicious of everything and most everyone (including myself).

Many have alrady written about King, Warrior, Magician, Lover by Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette. My review of the book could not possibly add anything more insightful. I particularly agree with [Benjamin I. Espen](http://www.benespen.com/journal/2011/8/17/king-warrior-magician-lover-book-review.html) conclusion about Moore and Gillette being "children of their age." I had to continually remind myself that the book is a product of the 90's (1990 to be exact). Every time the authors make mention or allude to the dissapearing old wise man who is the gate keeper to knowledge and wisdome, who initiates boys into men, i have to remember that this is written from the vantage point of 30 years ago. Has anything changed? No, not really.

**When I wrote this, I was listening to this song**
