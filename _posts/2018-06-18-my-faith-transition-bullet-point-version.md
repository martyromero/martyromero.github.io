I have been spending some time making a list of significant things in my past that have contributed to my faith ~~crisis~~ transition. These are in no particular order of importance. I don't want to comment on any of these in particular, but I did want to keep a list of moments, memories, events, ideas etc., that feel important. They also make perfect topics for future blog posts.

It's interesting to see how the majority of thee are centered around my early to mid 20s. 

**5 - 10 years old**

* Watching monks share the [Bhaghavad-Gita](https://www.asitis.com/){:target="_blank"} in the train station and being afraid of the pictures because mom told me that they were devils.

* Asking God for a sign that I would find my lost kitten, and getting an answer.

**11 - 15 years old**

* Reading [*The Mormon Murders*](https://www.amazon.com/Mormon-Murders-Story-Forgery-Deceit/dp/1250025893){:target="_blank"} and feeling my testimony of the Mormon church shake more by that book than by reading [Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible](https://www.amazon.com/Satanic-Bible-Anton-Szandor-Lavey/dp/0380015390/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1529396950&sr=1-1&keywords=satanic+bible){:target="_blank"}.

* Telling Eddie that "Even if God himself told me that the Mormon church was wrong, I would not leave it."

* [Pastor Walter Knight](http://www.rockportpilot.com/people/article_e434e962-181e-5c34-824f-c74250d1c455.html){:target="_blank"} challenging me to list a single evidence for the Book of Mormon, and not being able to. 

* Reading W. Kleon Skousen's [A Personal Search for the Meaning of the Atonement,](https://rcronk.wordpress.com/2007/07/27/a-personal-search-for-the-meaning-of-the-atonement/){:target="_blank"} and feeling that I had been in a state of slumber all of my life until then.
