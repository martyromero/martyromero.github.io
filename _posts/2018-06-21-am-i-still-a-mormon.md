## Am I still Mormon?
Last week my wife and I had a conversation where she said something along the lines of “…he knows that you use to be a Mormon.” That was an interesting phrase to hear, because I don’t consider myself non-Mormon. In fact, I still see myself as a Mormon. I do keep a list of Mormon policies and doctrines where the church and I differ. Some are trivial while others are more fundamental, but I still answer “yes” when asked “are you a Mormon?”

This is the question that I continue to ask myself. If I am not sure about some of the Mormon church’s truth claims, don’t believe others, and disagree with many the LDS church’s policies, am I still a Mormon?

## Am I anti-Mormon?
One of my professors in college once said something that has always stuck with me; “It takes about 20 years for a liberal to become a conservative.” He said that in the context of discussing change—particularly meaningful change. I made a commitment to prove him wrong, but when I look at my political views, and general perspective on life, I am pretty conservative—a HUGE distance away from the liberal, borderline radical views and perspectives that I held when I was younger. To a large degree my professor was right (at least about me). The thought occurred to me that if I transposed the terms Mormon and anti-Mormon in his statement, it would be true as well.

In almost every regards, the twenty-year old version of me would consider the forty-four-year old version of me an anti-Mormon. But how did it happen? It certainly happened the way my professor described change—very slowly. My mission president put it this way. “…It will happen the same way as the dew comes in the morning” meaning that it would happen so stealthily that it would be invisible. Of course my mission president was talking about how a testimony of the book of mormon/LDS church develops and would be flabbergasted if he heard me apply his description to the transition from Mormon to anti-Mormon.

To be honest, I don’t even know what that means (anti-Mormon). I was always taught to never seek truth from anti-Mormon literature. But no one ever clearly defined what made anti-Mormon literature anti-Mormon. I classified things and people 'anti-Mormon' the way others around me did. I knew that [Jerald and Sandra Tanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerald_and_Sandra_Tanner){:target="_blank"} were anti-Mormons and anything they wrote or said was anti-Mormon. I knew that the [Mormon Research Ministry (MRM)](http://www.mrm.org/){:target="_blank"} was an anti-Mormon organization, as well as [Saints Alive in Jesus](http://saintsalive.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Ed Decker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Decker){:target="_blank"} were anti-Mormon, just name a few. The more I was told to stay away from their writing, the more curious that I became, and sure enough, they were all full of lies, deception, half-truths and just plain old insults—that’s how processed what I read.

## I am neither anti- nor non- Mormon
Over the last four years I’ve gone back to read some of the research by the Tanner’s, MRM, Ed Decker and others. While I still feel that Ed Decker is most interested in propaganda, I do recognize that my own conclusions are more in line with the works that I once dismissed as anti-Mormon than with the LDS church. In other words, I have become an anti-Mormon.

In the talk [*A Gift of Dog Food*](https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Gift_of_Dogfood.html?id=ArEeAQAACAAJ){:target="_blank"} by [Brenton G. Yorgason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenton_G._Yorgason){:target="_blank"}, Brent describes an anti-Christ as someone who tries to destroy your testimony, or your God given self-esteem. I believe that this should be the definition of anti-Mormon, but it isn't. In my experience if something is true, but not in harmony with the main-stream narrative from the LDS church, what ever it is, it is anti-Mormon. Even if it is true. 

If I accept the latter definition of an anti-Mormon, then I am both a Mormon and anti-Mormon. But I think that while my attitude, beliefs, and opinions clash with Mormon orthodoxy, I am neither an anti- nor a non- Mormon. I am simply a Mormon in transition. That is a good enough answer to the question “are you Mormon?” The answer will likely change as I change, but for now that is what I am.
