## Monthaversary

We started celebrating our wedding each month from the very beginning. It annoyed me the first year. What a clich&eacute; I thought! My wife said that we would stop celebrating “monthaversaries” after our first year, but it didn’t stop.   We have missed a few months, only to come back a few days later and make a deal of it, even if it is only “hey, we forgot our monthaversary!” Today is our 116th wedding monthaversary, but it has been 217 months and 4 days since we met. 

Sure it’s true that we haven’t always made each other happy, and we both wish that many things had turned out differently, but I love her still. 

I hate taking her for granted, because the thought of not having her here to say “happy monthaversary” to on every sixth of the month is heavy with sadness.

## Happy Monthaversary dear wife!
