description: I use to drive to Cle Elum every weekend when we first moved to Ellensburg. I spent a lot of time writing and thinking. Much of what I wrote and thought about had to do with my wife. I wrote this thinking about her.

## I want to buy her flowers
I want to buy my girl flowers. I want to drive to a dark place where the lights are far with her. I want to look up at the sky at night. I want to hold her hand and gaze at the huge universe. I want to feel little and in awe at how big it all is. The desert, the sky, the galaxy that we live in. I love you Elizabeth.

*Beth and I loved listening to this song before we were married. It reminds me so much of the days when we were getting to know each other. I play this song on repeat when I miss her.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
