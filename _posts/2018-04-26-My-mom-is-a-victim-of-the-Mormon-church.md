## He was in love with me
I have been following the story of [McKenna Denson][2] closely. It is of particular interest to me because my mom has shared on a number of occasions about a former Mormon bishop who made sexual advances towards her multiple times when we first joined the Mormon church. 

As far as I know, that former bishop is still an active member of the church and was/has never been held accountable. 

I have a lot of Mormon friends that would look at a woman like Denson and say "Oh she's an anti-Mormon." But I hope that they can look beyond their own bias and call things for what they are. 

The Mormon church's policies and procedures are set up to protect sexual predators, and when I think of my mom being sexually accosted by a man who was allegedly "called of God" to be a spiritual leader, I feel angry and sick to my stomach.

My mom remains a fervent Mormon believer (despite her recent Catholic practices). She is fortunate that her experience assault was not more than advances.

*Dear LDS Church, I love you, but “Fuck you I won’t do what you tell me.”*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
