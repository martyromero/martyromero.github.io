## Measuring change
This winter wasn’t as rough as last, but it feels like it has been twice as long. I have been in Washington just days shy of 20 months . I can’t measure the difference between what it was like to move here and now by the things that have changed, only by the things that I miss. These are only a hand full of them:
* I miss music. I don’t listen to music as much as I did last year. My mind is so occupied with the things that I can’t get to that music doesn’t feel sacred like it did. This makes me really sad. 
* I miss driving to Cle Elum on Saturday mornings. This became a sacred time for me. I spent an hour writing, drawing, and reading over cup of coffee and a cinnamon twist. Besides being therapeutic, this time gave me a chance to plan things like how I want to spend my time, what kind of person I want to be and what kind of person I don’t want to be. Without that time I feel stuck.
* I miss journaling. Like music, journaling made me a bit more introspective. It forced me to look more, to listen more, to feel more.
* I miss my early morning routine. It included cleaning, prepping food for mom, prepping lunch, meditating, and spending time with my cats. 
* I miss my night routine. It started with an alarm at 9:25pm. “From Eden” by Hozier. 
* I miss Thursday lunches under the weeping willow tree at school. For an hour I listened to Tom Waitts while I had lunch and looked out at the ducks in the creek. 
* I miss the kindness of Davis company.
* I miss my mom. I miss walking by her room and seeing her sitting in bed smiling at me when I passed by. I miss her a lot.
* I miss LA. I could get lost by myself anywhere, any time. 
* I miss the feeling of having a home.
* I miss the feeling of having a friend that I could sit with, talk to, or just joke with
* I miss a comfortable bed.


**When I wrote this, I was listening to this song:**

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rROtyA6MtWU?rel=0&amp;t=27s&amp;showinfo=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

*The year that \<strike\>I broke up with my wife\</strike\> my wife broke up with me, this song got me through the sadness. I feel foolish to have trusted in a god that let me down so much. I need a better god.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
