*I use to listen to this song a lot when we first moved to Ellensburg. It use to bring me so much peace! Not so much anymore. Almost nothing does.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## Here it is. Don't judge!
By now in recent years I would already have posted my fall update. What I have done, learned, or become in the previous year, and what I hoped to do in the next. Not this time. 

**This is all I have**
1. My mother believes that I am being manipulated by my wife to destroy her
2. My wife makes me feel like I am an asshole*

I feel so alone, lonely, sad, and hopeless. The worst part is the facade that I have to put on in front of everyone. I am tired. 

*This is probably an exaggeration and I am guilty of doing things to make her feel the same or worse in return. But she refuses almost every opportunity to do life with me, and be my partner, and it is making my spirit shrivel inside.
