*I use to listen to this song a lot when we first moved to Ellensburg. It use to bring me so much peace! Not so much anymore. Almost nothing does.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## Here it is. Don't judge!
By now in recent years I would already have posted my fall update. What I have done, learned, or become in the previous year, and what I hoped to do in the next. Not this time. 

**This is all I have**
1. My mother believes that I am being manipulated by my wife to destroy her
2. My wife makes me feel like an asshole to be tolerated*

I feel so alone, lonely (those two are different), sad, and defeated. The worst part is the facade that I have to put on in front of everyone. I am tired. 

*This is an exaggeration to be sure. I too am guilty of doing things to make her feel the same or worse in return. But it is how I feel by the passive refusal to do life with me and be my partner. It is making my spirit shrivel inside.
