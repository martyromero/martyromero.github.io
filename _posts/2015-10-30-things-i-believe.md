I've spent a lot of time lately trying to describe—to myself mostly—what this past year has done to me. I came up with a list paradigm shifts that relate mostly to my crisis of faith that I seem to be experiencing.

The impetus for writing this down is due to recent visits by Mormon missionaries that have caused me to ask "what is it that I believe now?"

1. I DO NOT believe that it is OK for non-Mormon Christians to disqualify Mormons (or anyone for that matter) from being Christians. People should do that for themselves 
2. I DO NOT believe that it is OK for Mormons to claim that non-Mormon Christians do not have the [fullness of the Gospe](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2011/08/the-only-true-and-living-church?lang=eng) on account of not accepting the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith, Polygamy et. al.
3. I believe that the Mormon church (likely others) creates an unhealthy and even dangerous attitude towards intimacy and sex
4. I believe that all scripture is fallible
5. I believe that all scripture is good
6. I believe that the most worthy endavour that I can engage in while I am alive in this beautiful planet, is become the best human being I am capable of becoming
7. I believe that I have never met, or heard from "God", and that is OK
8. I believe in the power of music to heal, more than in the power of prayer
9. I believe that religion is an obstacle to #7
10. I believe that some people are evil
11. I believe that most people are kind
12. I believe the following more now than at any other time in my life:

>The real violence, the violence that I realized was unforgivable, is the violence that we do to ourselves when we're too afraid to be who we really are." - Nomi (Sense8, Season 1, Episode 2).
