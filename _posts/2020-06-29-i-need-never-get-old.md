## Songs help me breathe

I don't know what it is about some songs that simply make me want to put on my headphones, turn up the volume so all I can hear is music, close my eyes and just breathe.

For the same reasons that I wish the volume was turned way up on Miley Cyrus' vocals in [Joan Jett's cover of Crimson and Clover](https://youtu.be/DmQ2xOmy2MI) at 3:12+, for those reasons I love every second of this cover, especially at 1:16, 1:50, 1:55, and 2:31 until the end.
