## My wife asked

Yesterday my wife asked me, “why don’t you have a music blog, since music seems to be so therapeutic for you?” (paraphrasing). I wasn’t sure how to answer, so I’ve thought about it all day and I think that I could give her a better answer today.

**Background**  
One year ago I began to listen to Tom Waits daily. I was familiar with his songs before, but not like I am now. I first listened to Tom’s music when I was in high school, but I was so dismissive and obsessed with [The Doors](https://youtu.be/AYCB80WcaSI) and [Led Zeppelin](https://youtu.be/RlNhD0oS5pk) to really appreciate his lyrics and songs. At one point I had all of his albums on cassette up to his 1993’s [“Black Rider”](https://youtu.be/epxgkNouwrU) (I wish I knew what happened to them).

My first MP3s of his were [“Mule Variations”](https://youtu.be/c_OkcVLBB9A) which I bought sometime in 2005. I loved most of the songs in that album, but I always skipped track sixteen. I would just start over. It wasn’t until a few years ago when [“Come on Up to the House”](https://youtu.be/c_OkcVLBB9A?t=1h6m10s) finally broke through me, or rather broke me. Life has to teach you a lessons or two about loss, and grief to appreciate the depth of Tom’s songs. This song was no exception. It became my friend when I was most alone.

**Come On Up To The House**

Well the moon is broken  
And the sky is cracked  
Come on up to the house  
The only things that you can see  
Is all that you're lacking  
Come on up to the house

All your cryin' don't do no good  
Come on up to the house  
Come down off the cross  
We can use the wood  
You gotta come on up to the house

Come on up to the house  
Come on up to the house  
The world is not my home  
I'm just a passin' thru  
You got to come on up to the house

There's no light in the tunnel  
No irons in the fire  
Come on up to the house  
And your singin' lead soprano  
In a junkman's choir  
You got to come on up to the house

Does life seem nasty, brutish and short  
Come on up to the house  
The seas are stormy  
And you can't find no port  
Got to come on up to the house

[Chorus]

There's nothin in the world  
that you can do  
you gotta come on up to the house  
and you been whipped by the forces  
that are inside you  
come on up to the house  
well you're high on top  
of your mountain of woe  
come on up to the house  
well you know you should surrender  
but you can't let go  
you gotta come on up to the house

[Chorus]

[“Come on Up to the House”](https://youtu.be/c_OkcVLBB9A?t=1h6m10s) still makes me cry when I listen to it, and there is a lot more that I can say about the song (I will later in another post). I don’t listen to it very often. Not because I am afraid of it, but because it is a special song for me and I find it very moving. I still remember the feeling of it penetrating through me, and the warmth that I felt in its long embrace.

## My answer

I don't write a music blog because music is so much more than therapeutic for me. I don't feel that I could do it justice if I wrote about music. When I listen to music, I often feel that I am in the presence of something divine. I feel that there is something in music that is more than the sound coming into my ears. It doesn’t mean that I think music or musicians are define-far from it—but I am certain that there is something devine in music. I believe that "God" is in music, but not in a “God-is-working-through-music-to-talk-to-you” way as some Christian people I know have suggested. That perspective bastardizes what music means to me. It's something different that is difficult to explain, but no one else besides me needs to understand it. That is why I don't write about music.

**Thank you for this song Tom Waits.**
