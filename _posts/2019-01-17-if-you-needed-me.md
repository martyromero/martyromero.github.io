title: If you needed me
summary: We have been together for so long and I still don't feel like I know how to ease her pain. I don't know what to do to protect her and that frightens me to my core. I am sad with her!

I shared a song with my wife earlier this week that I have been listening to a lot lately. The original was written by Townes Van Zandt in 1972, but the version linked below is from the soundtrack to the movie [“Broken Circle Breakdown.”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024519/)

I already liked the song for the song’s sake, but juxtaposed against the movie, it reminds me of one life’s most wretched tragedies, and a fear that saddens me to my core—not knowing how to, or not being able able to protect the people that I love deeply or ease their pain. [I have written before](/i-owe-this-song-to-my-friends) about how some songs have an uncanny ability to express emotions that words alone often cannot, and I think that this is one of them.

My wife shared a moment of sadness with me today. It was about not having children and it saddened me also. We have been together for so long and I still don't know how to ease her pain. I don't know how to protect her. I am sad with her.

*From the movie "The Broken Circle Breakdown" which is magnificent. There is a swedish version of this song ([Om jag behövde dig](https://youtu.be/rpqHRQDoI3g)) that I also like.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
