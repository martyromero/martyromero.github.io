title: If you needed me
summary: We have been together for so long and I still don't feel like I know how to ease her pain. I don't know what to do to protect her and that frightens me to my core. I am sad with her!

Beth shared a moment of sadness with me today. It was about not having children and it made me sad also. We have been together for so long and I still don't feel like I know how to ease her pain. I don't know what to do to protect her and that frightens me to my core. I am sad with her!

*I shared this song with my wife a few days ago. It's a beautiful duet written by Townes Van Zandt in 1972. This version is from the movie "The Broken Circle Breakdown." I have already written about certain songs that so profoundly express one's feelings. This song is one of them, and the movie is just magnificent. There is a swedish version of the song [Om jag beh√∂vde dig](https://youtu.be/rpqHRQDoI3g) that I also love.*{:.post-hero}*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
