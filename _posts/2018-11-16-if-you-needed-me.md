*This is City Hall in L.A. It's the where the 'Occupy' movement took place. It is also my favorite childhood building. I use to think that this was the building from which Superman flew out of and into in the show 'The Adventures of Superman.'*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## Hello Los Angeles
I feel like a failure a lot of the times. At work, I am on a constant race to catch up. At home, my wife doesn't feel safe around me and my mother wishes I were a more understanding son. My cats are bored and depressed because I don't play with them, and our house is kind of a mess without even the most basic set of furniture.

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GLvohMXgcBo?rel=0&amp;t=27s&amp;showinfo=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
