On my drive home the other night I noticed a scar on the backside of my thumb.
It's burn scar that just healed a month ago or so ago. There is nothing
particulaly special about it, but it caught my eye and I began to notice other scars on my hand. 

There is a scar in the knucke of my index finter  from the fight with roger in
seventh grade. There is a scar on my index finger from building the dining table five
years ago, and a cut on my ring finger from the time I fell while learning to ride my
first bicycle. 

I was thinking about the cut in my ring finger when I began to think about how
I have treated body. I began to wonder what my body would say to me if it were a
separate person. Would he shake his fist in the air and curse me for being so careless with him? 

I don't sleep enough. I don't exercise. I eat too much sugar, and more carbs
than I need. I drink very little water. I don't mediate, I don't takee
my medication regularlly and I can't remember the last time when I honestly felt
in good health. And yet, there isn't any reason to think that my
body would hate or curse me. Despite how poorly I have taken care of my body, it
continues to carry me through each day, faithfully.

I feel embarrased for being such a poor stewart of such a beautiful gift. It's
not the kind of shame from being too fat, too short or from noticing that I
am starting to go bald. I feel embarrased for being so unkind. I tear up when I
think about it and even writing about it now I find that I have to stop if I
don't want to explain why I'm crying.

*When I heard the news that Juan Gabrial had passed I became emotional. It was a
similar feeling like the one I experienced when Steve Jobs passed. It took me by
surprise. This is one of my favorite songs by him (Juan Gabriel). THis is my
favorite cover right now.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
