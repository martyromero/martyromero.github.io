**Hi, my name is José Romero**, but most people call me [Marty](http://theycallmemarty.com "Why do they call me marty?"). I am a Designer, Educator, and all around Technology nerd.

In this corner of the internet I write mostly about life as it happens. A lot of it is personal and mostly written for an audience of one—me. I live in Los Angeles with my [wife](http://nedandthefrog.com "Ned and the Frog") and my four cats. You can also find me in the usual digital neighborhoods like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/martyromero "Marty Romero at Twitter"), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/katerone "I am on Instagram"), and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/martyromero "The place for grown-ups").

Stay a while and get to know me. [Say hello](mailto:hi@theycallmemarty.com "hi") and tell me where I can find  you on line. I love a good story!
