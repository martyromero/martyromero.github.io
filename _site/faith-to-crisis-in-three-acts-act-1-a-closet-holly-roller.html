<h2 id="a-closet-holly-roller">A closet “Holly Roller”</h2>

<p>My perspective on religion has changed at least twice. Before the two years that I spent as a missionary for the Mormon church, I was timid about starting religious conversations with anyone. This was particularly pronounced during my junior high school years.</p>

<p>The Mormon church use to have a program where boys ages twelve through eighteen were paired up with their fathers once a month to drive around the city collecting donations from members of the local congregation. This typically happened once a month on the first Saturday of the month, and kids like me—whose dad was absent in the home—were paired up with male adult members of the church who didn’t have boys or whose boys were not twelve yet. Because the Mormon church that I attended was in the same neighborhood where I went to school, my biggest concern was being seen by school friends in my white shirt and tie performing my church duty. I was embarrassed. I don’t know where I picked up the idea, but I believed that church-going people were weak and ridiculous.</p>

<p>I learned to compartmentalize life very early and I couldn’t bare the thought of being discovered by my friends as a “Holly Roller.” At school I was a popular graffiti tagger, but on weekends I had a secret identity. I was a “Holly Roller.” On Sundays I was “pure.” I prayed, I fasted, I read scriptures, I said things like “I know this church is true.” I was also quiet and timid—something opposite to the persona that my friends knew Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>I graduated from high school in 1992 and four years later I decided to fulfill my expected two-year duty to the Mormon church as a full-time missionary. Missionary service marked the first of two changes in my religious perspective. As a Missionary, I found that most people were not only willing but excited to share the most intimate details about their religious experience with me. For the majority it was comforting to speak about their  belief in God, their feelings about church, morality, purity and salvation. When they spoke, they didn’t sound ridiculous and they didn’t appear weak. I was wrong to have thought so. I had compartmentalized my life the wrong way.</p>

<h2 id="a-room-in-my-house">A Room in My House</h2>

<p>I was twenty-two when I became a Mormon Missionary.  I never felt the same urgency or excitement about it that my friends did. Boys were expected to begin their Missionary service at nineteen, but at that age I still found it hard to talk religion with anyone. I didn’t have a reason to be embarrassed about sharing with others that I was a religious person. But I was—embarrassed. Church, spirituality and religiosity still happened on Sundays for me, but during the week my life was divided into different “rooms.” There was a room for work life, another for school life, and yet another for my social life . There was a room for every different aspect of my life. It made it easy for me to move from one area of responsibility to the next without needing to reconcile any discrepancies or resolve conflicts between them. I could record and be paid for unworked hours by my employer Monday through Friday and learn about honesty and integrity at church on Sunday without feeling guilt.</p>

<p>I returned home from serving the Mormon church in 1999. I was back in familiar places amongst friends and family, but I was different. I had been changed by the Missionary experience. I returned home with a deep desire to wear out my life serving God—which to me, was synonymous with serving the LDS church. Everything I did became an appendage to my religion. My academic success or failure, my social life, my professional work, my relationships etc., it  was all a shaped by my faith (or lack of). I took the <a href="http://www.ldsmissionarymoms.com/notablequotes/MMCsign.shtml" title="LDS Missionary Commision">LDS Missionary Commission</a> to heart (while I was a missionary and when I returned), particularly this part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…He has chosen me to represent Him—to stand in His place, to say and do what He Himself would say and do… My voice is His voice, and my acts are His acts; my doctrine is His doctrine. My Commission is to do what He wants done; to say what He wants said; to be a living modern witness in word and in deed of the divinity of his great and marvelous Latter-day work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If my life use to be a house made up of various rooms each with a specific purpose—a room where religion happened, one for social life, another for academic endeavors, another for work and professional life etc., serving as a missionary didn’t stop me from compartmentalizing, but it did changed where religion happened. Religion use have a room of its own. Now, religion happened in a common area—the kitchen. More specifically religion became the stew on the stove. It became the aroma and that aroma permitted every other room in the house.</p>

<h2 id="god-salvation-and-morality">God, Salvation and Morality</h2>

<p>Like a lot of returned missionaries, I was a “faithful” mormon who believed  the following about religion:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Mormon church was the only <em>true and living church</em> in the face of the earth, restored through the hands of Joseph Smith.</li>
  <li>The Book of Mormon was a historical, ancient book written in a modified version of Hebrew and Egyptian by ancient holy men living in the American continent.</li>
  <li>That the Book of Mormon had been translated by Joseph Smith through the power of God.</li>
  <li>That only within the Mormon church, the legitimate authority to pronounce blessings, interpret scripture, and issue  proclamations in God’s name—the Priesthood—could be found.</li>
</ol>

<p>About God, I believed that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>God had a physical body of flesh and bone.</li>
  <li>God was all-knowing, all-powerful and all-good.</li>
  <li>God dwelt in heaven.</li>
  <li>God’s love for me was such that He allowed Jesus to be put to death and through that sacrifice I had the opportunity to repent and return to live with Him in heaven.</li>
  <li>God was involved in the most minute of my life’s details. From the most insignificant to the most important issues, God was literally experiencing life with me. In other words, I was never alone.</li>
  <li>Through prayer I could have a conversation with God and that God would always engage with me. If I were attentive and keenly tuned, I could experience communion with God.</li>
</ol>

<p>Salvation in the Mormon church is shrouded in controversy because some of the doctrines that make up salvation in the LDS church are quite peculiar and unique. I never objected to any of them, but I didn’t feel a strong conviction that they were all true. What I did believed about salvation was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Salvation entailed an eternity in the presence of God, indescribable joy for me and my family.</li>
  <li>Salvation was a lifelong process that had happened, was happening, and would ultimately happen at some point in the future.</li>
  <li>To borrow a metaphor from C.S. Lewis, the mechanics of salvation—faith and works—operate in a fashion similar to a pair of scissors.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Christians have often disputed as to whether what leads the Christian home is good actions, or faith in Christ … it does seem to me like asking which blade in a pair of scissors is most necessary.”</p>

  <p>C. S. Lewis, Mere Christianity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really only ever had one belief about morality. It was this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Morality is a life that exhibits behavior in harmony with an individual’s religious convictions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="as-the-dew-in-the-morning">As the Dew in the Morning</h2>

<p>Over the years I began to change. The change was as slow as the dew falling on grass in the mornings. It was a gradual process with such stealth that it was just short of invisible, but one that changed almost everything that I believed about these three things; God, Salvation and Morality.</p>
