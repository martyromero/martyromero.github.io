        Things I believe (and two that I don't)
      </a>
    </h1>
    <p>I have spent a lot of my time trying to describe—to myself mostly—what this last year has done to me. I came up with a list. The list represents major paradigm shifts for me. A crisis, a journey, or perhaps the first time that I document (with some thought) feelings that I’ve long had.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the Mormon missionaries have been coming by recently and their visit has caused me to think more about a “faith crisis” I find myself in since about a year ago. These are some of the things that I know I believe for certain. I also list a couple of things that I don’t believe. This feels like a fitting topic for a first blog post.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I DO NOT believe that it is OK for non-LDS Christians to write lists of items that disqualify Mormons from being Christians.</li>
  <li>I DO NOT believe that it is OK for LDS to claim that non-LDS Christians do not have the “Fullness of the Gospel” on account of not accepting the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith, Polygamy et. al.</li>
  <li>I believe that the Church (LDS and non) creates an unhealthy and even dangerous attitude towards intimacy and sex.</li>
  <li>I believe that all scripture (LDS and non) is fallible.</li>
  <li>I believe that all scripture is good.</li>
  <li>I believe that a genuine relationship with oneself is more important than an artificial relationship with “God.”</li>
  <li>I believe that the universe has seen my story unfold one million times before. I too will grow old and die and be forgotten. I am not unique. I am peacefully comfortable with this.</li>
  <li>I believe that the best thing that I can do with my time in this beautiful planet, is be the best human being that I can be. Especially to the people who are closest to me.</li>
  <li>I believe that I have always misunderstood the concept of “God”, and that is OK.</li>
  <li>I believe that “being true to oneself” is selfish.</li>
  <li>I believe that we should be true to our word no matter the cost. This lesson has come at a steep price.</li>
  <li>I believe in the power of music to heal, more than in the “power of prayer.”</li>
  <li>I believe that religion has become an obstacle to #8.</li>
  <li>I believe that some people are evil.</li>
  <li>I believe that most people are kind.</li>
  <li>I believe the following more now than at any other time in my life:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real violence, the violence that I realized was unforgivable, is the violence that we do to ourselves when we’re too afraid to be who we really are.” - Nomi (Sense8, Season 1, Episode 2).</p>
