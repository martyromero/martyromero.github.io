title: I am outnumbered by women
summary: Now and then I am reminded that there are absolutely NO men in my life. Well, that isn’t entirely true, but it is technically. Why does it make a difference? It doesn’t in the day-to-day of my life, but it makes a colossal difference in the aggregate.

*I recently sent the picture above to someone I know with a message that read "I just finished making and having dinner with five ladies. One is missing, but here are four of them." That is when I realized that I was outnumbered two-to-one.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## I am outnumbered
This winter wasn’t as rough as last, but it feels like it has been twice as long. In just one year, I feel like so much has happened. I can’t measure the difference by the things that have changed, only by the things that I miss. 

* I miss music. I don’t listen to music like I did last year. My mind is so occupied with the things that I can’t get to that music doesn’t feel sacred like it did. This makes me really sad. 
	* I miss driving to Cle Elum on Saturday mornings. This became a sacred time for me. I spent an hour writing, drawing, and reading. 
	* I miss journaling. Like music, journaling made me a bit more introspective. It caused me to look more, to listen more, to feel more.
	* I miss my early morning routine. It included cleaning, prepping food for mom, prepping lunch, meditating, and spending time with my cats. 
	* I miss my night routine. It always started with an alarm at 9:25pm. “From Eden” by Hozier. 
	* I miss Thursday lunches under that weeping willow where I would sit and listen to the wind, and looking at the ducks play in the creek. 
	* I miss the kindness of Davis company.
	* I miss my mom. I miss walking by her room and seeing her sitting in bed smiling at me when I passed by. I miss her a lot.
	* I miss LA. I could get lost by myself anywhere, any time. 
	* I miss the feeling of having a home.
	* I miss the feeling of having a friend that I could sit with, talk to, or just joke with
	* I miss a comfortable bed.

**When I wrote this, I was listening to this song:**
 <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pte3Jg-2Ax4?rel=0&amp;t=27s&amp;showinfo=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

*Thirteen by Big Star. The lyrics to this song are irrelevant to anything on this post, but the melody makes me melancholic. Quite like I am feeling now.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
