this is another 
Three years ago my life collapsed (metaphorically). On the worst day, I found myself sleeping in my car, paraalized with fear about what direction in life I should take. It sounds more dramatic than it really was. Physically, and materially I was ok. I wasn't homeless and I had a decent job. But emotionally and spiritually, I crumbled. I found myself alone in a way that I had never been before. That loneliness too, is metaphorical. On October 12th, 2014 I confessed to my wife that I had been having an affair for almost a year.

I had a panic attack this morning. It was triggered by something so insignificant. I left my lunch on the kitchen table while I got ready for work. With eight cats, one of them was bound to notice. I didn't hear it fall, but one of them knocked the containers to the floor. Fortunately, the containers both had lids on and my lunch didn't end up all over the kitchen floor. Although, in retrospect, that would have been the lesser evil. What I got, instead was two food containers each with an unremarkable tossed salad. 

My lunch was ruined! Only that it wasn't, but it wasn't what I had planned and I immediately felt a small numbness in my brain. Physically, it began as an incredibly anxious feeling in my pelvis that caused my foot to stomp quietly, yet aggressively in front of the fridge. I also noticed the cadence of my breath change. Instead of long, smooth breaths, they were shorter and stronger, and my stomach muscles contracted with each exhale. On my way out I stopped my usual minute or two to appreciate the new patch of baby grass in the front lawn, but my jaw was stiff and I was grinding my teeth with force. After a few seconds I was on my way to work.

half a mile away from home my eyes couldn't contain the tears. They were mostly out of frustration and panic. I tried to not let my wife see me, but I think she noticed. She took her hand and held my left forearm for a bit. I was grateful that she didn't ask or mention it. It would have made it worse.



It was fluffs. I'm sure that he could smell the food through the plastic container
