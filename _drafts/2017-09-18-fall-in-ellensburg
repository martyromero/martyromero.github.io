## Fall Playlist
It isn't officially Fall for another four days, but I have already started to put together my new Fall playlist on Spotify.

It's been a year of new things, so a lot of the songs are new to me.
Fall has always been a time for new beginnings for me. Even More than New Years,
so some of these songs are also songs associated with new things in my life like chanting, meditating,
writing etc.

Fall also marks our first year in a new town, so, some of these songs are also songs that remind me of
my days in L.A. and our first days in Ellensburg.

**Fall 2017 Playlist.**
