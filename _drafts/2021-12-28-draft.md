My sister's left leg never fully developed and had to be amputated five inches below her knee when she was born. As she got older and grew, her fibula grew also and it became painful as the
bone push against her skin. So, up until the age of eight we traveled to L.A. two to three
times a year to have surgery on her leg. Thankfully
she only reached only 5'1" and only required surgeries until she reached Jr. High.

## The kitten

The summer before this one particular trip we were adopted by the most adorable
black kitten. He was full of joy and cuteness like all kittens are. Every morning he would scratch at the door until he was let ou to poop and play. In the beginning we worried that he would run away or be hurt, or hungry, but quickly we
discovered that he liked to play and be outdoors. He liked to play particularly in the graphe vine that
grew in the front yard. He hid from us behind the leaves as we walked by like a
game of hide and seek and came out from his hiding spot after we passed by.

## Traveling to L.A.

But This time we would be gone for two weeks and I worred about coming back
and not finding him. Who would feed him? Where would he sleep? Who would tend to him if he got hurt?

We came back from L.A. to find everyone of my worries realized. The kitten was
gone! I spent the next several days looking for him unsuccessfully. I felt
helpless and sad because I had let him down. I left him and he was gone.

Mom quickly fell back into the day's routine, my sister stayed in bed recovering and
I was made to go back to school in the afternoons. I thought about him at every
minute. Looking for him unsuccessfully was my first experience feeling anxiety and depression.

It must have been a week when I was ready to give up looking for him. I recall the day and the time when it happend. Mom called me to get ready for school, but I took a bit longer to respond.I sat there straddling the fence. One leg on the side of our property and the other to the empty lot next door to our house. I stared at the overgrown grass that covered the empty lot wondering
where had I not yet looked. There were a couple of old tires on top of the extra
pieces of wood that we had tossed the previoius year. The wood had alredy began
to rot with the moisture from the rain an the heat of the sun that summer.

"I alredy looked there" I thought

I watched as a butterfly landed on a flower a little distance away from me. Just then, for no particular reason I thought of
praying.

## It happened

I had never prayed before. I'd never needed anything that rose to the level of prayer.
But I had seen mom pray and I knew that in prayer you could ask God for things.
My prayer was simple (and perhaps a bit presumpteous).

"God, if I am going to find my kitten and I should continue the search, make (I
meant ask, but I remember thinking "make") that butterly land on the largest
petal in this flower that is near me."

I hadn't finished thinking the word "me" when the butterfly fluttered away in a
random pattern towards me and sat on that flower, on that petal. It was the very
one that I had chosen as the sign in my prayer. And no more than a full breadth
went by that I heard a faint "meow". I heard it again. I forgot about the
butterfly, and school, and even my prayer. I quickly jumped off the fence towards the old tires and
rotting wood.

"meow"

I heard it again. There in the hollow of the old tire I found the scared black
kitten looking up at me.

I never heard from God again the way I did on that occasion. In the aggregate of
a life losing a kitten feels like an insignificant event. Was it a
coincidence? The buttlerfly, the specific petal on that specific flower? Finding him
immediately after asking? and then silence. Through all the life altering
events, through all the loneliness, through the sadness and the hurt... silence. If it was
a coincidence, boy, what a coincidence!

## The lesson

I don't mean to sound preachy about the power of prayer. I've said it before that music has more often been more healing that prayer. I also don't mean to imply that I never prayed again. I did. I just never heard from God again.

_When I heard the news that Juan Gabrial had passed I became emotional. It was a
similar feeling like the one I experienced when Steve Jobs passed. It took me by
surprise. This is one of my favorite songs by him (Juan Gabriel). THis is my
favorite cover right now._{:.image-caption .clearfix}
