## 2019 Fall Reflections 
This post is late. Usually I like to reflect on the last twelve months at the beginning of the fall, but fall is about a month away from being over. Though I haven't had a chance to keep up on major changes since about July, here is what has changed over the last year.

1. **I am not as good at things like I thought I was** I use to think that I had very little room for improvement when it came to communicating, reading people, managing relationships (personal and work). As it turns out, I kind of suck at things in general. I mostly do a mediocre job at everything I do. I am just good enough to make people think that I know what I am doing, but I don't. If people only looked a little closer they would know how much of a fake I am. On my favor is the fact that I am also not as important that people would look closer. But I do want to be better at least at one thing. I want to be better than mediocre at loving my wife and mom in all instances. But I suck at it when I am stressed, or tired, or mad, or distracted, or busy, or mostly anything else. This is the one thing that I want to be good at. 
2. **Life is an urgent affair** I take for granted almost everything about life. Mostly because much of the time it feels like everything is so mundane. I wake up to the same routine day after day. I shower, get ready for work, come home, spend a bit of time with mom, do a bit of work, watch a lot of YouTube and go to bed to toss and turn for four or five hours only to do it over again the next day. But without notice one of my cat dies, or I find myself talking to a doctor about mom's end of life being just months away and suddenly the mundane things have so much meaning. On a daily basis I find myself thinking or rather asking myself if this will be the last time that I will do what ever it is that I am doing. "is this the last time I make dinner for mom?", "Is this the last time I will see my wife?", "Will this be the last time I pet any one of my cats?" I am in constant fear of loosing the things that I love the most. This is a new fear for me. It paralyzes me and I mostly go numb. 
3. **I miss my music** I had a ritual when I first moved to Ellensburg. I should have known that it could not possibly be sustainable in the long run. It was my music. I found solace and comfort in it. I use write, and read, and meditate more. I would like to recover some of that, but ai feel numb a lot of the time now and mostly want to be asleep. This is another face of depression. It's probably the side that I hate most because it keeps me from feeling anything.
4. **I had a fallout with my sister again** I feel abandoned by her. I am angry at her. I am sad and hurt because she kept me from having a relationship with my nephews. If I die without making peace with her, it will be the second thing that I regret in life.
5. **I feel alone** I don't feel lonely, but I feel alone. I don't feel very much like I have a partner. This is sad and mostly my fault. I wish that I had a closer relationship with my wife, but I don't feel like I have any right to ask her for anything.
6. **I don't have any friends** I like the people that I work with. Many of them have become some of my favorite people, but I refuse to become friends. I don't carry on any conversations with anyone outside of mom and my wife. This is going to come back to me in a bad way when I am old and my wife is no longer around. For now, I am still not interested in making any friends here.
7. **I miss my cat** I try to remember him every month. Mostly I forget when the day comes. On at least two occasions I have had to walk out of a meeting because without any warning I feel like I am choking just like I did when I held his little limb body. I don't know if I'll ever get over it. I am not sure that I want to, but at least once a week I collapse with sadness. Sometimes while I am driving, other time in my office, or when I am lying in bed tossing trying to sleep. I miss him.
8. **I want feel sad for and because of mom** This year more than any other in the past I have felt the fragility of mom's life. In june I was having conversations with hospice doctors about mom's last wishes. Does she want to die at home "it is going to happen and it is months away" was what Dr. martin told me. Months! Well it is months and every morning, sometimes multiple times at night I wake up and sit next to mom in her room making sure that she is breathing. The irony is that on those nights sitting in her room staring at her, I wish that she went back to the days when her dementia was the worst thing we had to deal with. ahem. 
9. **I am dying** I am not really, but my glucose is not yet under control and my eyes are finally showing signs of damage. I need to handle this. 

In general, I don't feel like I have grown much. I haven't really learned anything new and when that happens I feel like I have been floating in the same place for a year. I really love my job and that provides enough challenges to keep me busy, but without any personal growth, reflection, introspection or whatever you want to call it, I feel like I haven't moved.

*I can't remember who shared this song with me, but I know that I wasn't the one who found it. Soraya passed from breast cancer in 2006. She was only 37. I have outlived her.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
