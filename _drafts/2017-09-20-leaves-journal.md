## I was feeling broken

*Today I picked you, because you kind of look the way I feel.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## I was feeling inadequate

*You look so wicked! You deserve to hang in a gallery somewhere, but I saw you first. What is it like to look so wickedly handsome?*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## I was feeling sad, unloved, but needing courage to go on

*Because despite months of snow you are still green. The cold didn't phase you did it? You are just what I needed to see after a week overcome with sadness.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## I was experiencing a deep feeling of love for my wife

*You were 116th monthaversary. She said that you were the best bouquet ever. You really were a pretty flower. I hope that she thought of me every time she saw you. Thank you.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## I felt a deep sense of gratitude towards movement

*Mom smiled like she does when she is joyful. I don't see that joy in her as often any more. I love her and I know that one day I will miss her. Thank you for giving her joy through the week.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## I was feeling a longing for the spring
![A picture of a petal. I don't remember what type of flower.]({{ site.siteurl }}/public/posts/leave-6.jpg)
*I found this flower poking out of the snow on my way to toastmasters. My first winter in Ellensburg was rough and I really felt the need for something colorful. I felt overwhelmed.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

This doesn't say much about what I might have been doing at the time, but I remember perfectly what I was feeling. It's how I journal sometime.
