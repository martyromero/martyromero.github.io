## Fall
It's official. Fall is here! Most people associate Spring with rebirth and newness--with good reason--but I don't. For me, its the Fall
that represents new beginnings and rebirths—more so than Spring or new years. To borrow a couple of metaphors from Christianity, Fall feels like
a "born-again" experience——a "baptism." Nature wipes the slate clean. What needs to die, dies and a new version of that thing is sown.

Fall is also a particularly good time for me to reflect on the previous year and look forward to the next. A lot of the more significant events
in my life have taken place in the Fall, and last Fall was no exception. So, here are ten lessons that I have learned in the past twelve months.

**1. I don't have to fix everything.**
Life has constantly thrown things at me that left me feeling hopeless and broken. I no longer feel that I need to fix it all. I can leave
some things unfixed and even out of my life.
