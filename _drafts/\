## Subtitle
It's my favorite season in Ellensburg again--fall. It's also time when I reflect on the past twelve months. The year flew by faster than I expected or wanted. The first half of the year was rough. Mom was in and out of the hostpital monthly and in June the doctors were sure that mom would be gone within a matter of months. The experience left me feeling empty and my work responsibilities have kept me feeling so. I don't like it. It isn't so much that I think 'Empty' is necessarily bad, but it isn't particularly good either.

Then there is the general feeling of complacency, which I hate the most. I miss the feeling of being new in a new town.

I forget that mom is also human in the same way that I am human. Change affects her in the same ways that it affects me. Her dementia aside, the change from what she knew all of her life to a different home, different rules, different town, different people, and life's blatant reminder that she is old and must depend on others for the most basic things couldn't have possibly been easy for her. It still isn't, but she is learning to cope.

This time around she is handling living with me and Beth better.
