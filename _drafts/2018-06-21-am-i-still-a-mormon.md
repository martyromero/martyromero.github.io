## Am I still Mormon?
Last week my wife and I had a conversation where she said something along the lines of “…he knows that you use to be a Mormon.” That was an interesting phrase to hear, because I don’t consider myself non-Mormon. In fact, I still see myself as a Mormon. I keep a list of where the LDS church and I differ. Some of the items on my list are policy and some are doctrinal; some are trivial while others are fundamental, but I still answer “yes” when asked “are you a Mormon?”

This is the question that I continue to ask myself. If I am not sure about some of the Mormon church’s truth claims, and right out don’t believe others. And if I agree with very few of the LDS church’s policies, am I still a Mormon?

## Am I anti-Mormon?
One of my professors in college once said something that has always stuck with me; “It takes about 20 years for a liberal to become a conservative.” He said that in the context of discussing change—particularly meaningful change. I made a commitment to prove him wrong, but when I look at my political views, and general perspective on life, I am pretty conservative—a HUGE distance away from the liberal, borderline radical views and perspectives that I held when I was younger. To a large degree my professor was right (at least about me). The thought occurred to me that if I transposed the terms “mormon” and “anti-mormon” in his statement, it would be true as well.

In almost every regards, the twenty-year old version of me would consider the forty-four-year old version of me an anti-mormon. How did it happen? It certainly happened the way my professor described change—very slowly. My mission president put it this way. “…It will be as the dew in the morning” meaning that it would happen so stealthily, that it would be invisible. Of course my mission president was talking about how a testimony of the book of mormon/LDS church develops and would be flabbergasted if he heard me apply that description to the transition from being a mormon to becoming an anti-mormon.

To be honest, I don’t even know what that means (anti-mormon). I was always taught to never seek truth from anti-mormon literature. But no one ever clearly defined what made anti-mormon literature anti-mormon. I just kind of classified things and people “anti-mormon” the way others around me did. I knew that Jerald and Sandra Tanner were anti-mormons and anything they wrote was anti-mormon. I knew that the Mormon Research Ministry (MRM) was an anti-mormon organization, as well as Saints Alive in Jesus and Ed Decker were anti-mormon, just name a few. The more I was told to stay away from their writing, the more curious that I became, and sure enough, they were all full of lies, deception, half-truths and just plain old insults—that’s how processed what I read.

## I am neither anti- nor non- Mormon
Over the last four years I’ve gone back to read some of the research by the Tanner’s, MRM, Ed Decker and others. While I still feel that Ed Decker is most interested in propaganda, I do recognize that my own conclusions are more in line with the works that I once dismissed as anti-mormon than with the LDS church. In other words, I have become an anti-mormon. I don’t feel like an anti-mormon though. I don’t even know what that is, but as far as I can tell, if it is true, but not in harmony with the main-stream narrative from the LDS church, it is anti-mormon.

If I accept that definition of an anti-mormon, then I am both a Mormon and anti-Mormon. But I think that while my attitude and opinions of the LDS church might classify me as a non-Mormon, or anti-Mormon, I am neither an anti- nor a non- Mormon. But I need an adequate answer when ever I ask myself, or am asked the question “are you Mormon?” The answer will likely change as I change, but for now I feel that I am simply a Mormon in transition.
