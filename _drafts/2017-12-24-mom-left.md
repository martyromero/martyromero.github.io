title: I am outnumbered by women
summary: Now and then I am reminded that there are absolutely NO men in my life. Well, that isn’t entirely true, but it is technically. Why does it make a difference? It doesn’t in the day-to-day of my life, but it makes a colossal difference in the aggregate.

*I recently sent the picture above to someone I know with a message that read "I just finished making and having dinner with five ladies. One is missing, but here are four of them." That is when I realized that I was outnumbered two-to-one.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}

## Subtitle
I haven't written anything since the end of October. October is my mom's birthday month. It was the year mark month in which mom and Beth arrived to Ellensburg. I haven't really listened to music since. At least not in the way that I do. There is a Spotify playlist that I listened to most of the year. I stopped listening to it sometime at the beginning of the summer. 

Listening to the songs take me back to four in the morning waking up stealthily to not wake up Beth or mom to clean the kitchen, living and dining area and spare room. Meditating, writing and just sitting to listen to music. those early mornings waking up to clean and prepare mom's breakfast and lunch. 

Figuring out what to do or say so that my wife wouldn't think that I was a jerk. Worrying about mom's next doctor apointment or trip to the store. 

I wish I could have sat longer with mom, talked with her longer, held her hand twice, smiled more, sat by her longer, hugged her longer for no reason at all. I wish I'd loved her better, cared for her more, spoken kinder words to her. I wish she wasn't sick. I didn't mean to yell at her, I didn't mean to be unkind. I wish I could have said "I love you" more. I wish I would have said yes to more things and not cared about the scuffs on the walls or scratches on the doors. I wish that I would have driven with her to the river more often and sat by the tracks to watch the train go by more. I wish I'd made more meals to have with her and watched movies. I wish I would have taken her to seattle more often, watched more concerts with her. 

It's been sad, but I also have to be glad/happy because of my wife. I am. I love two people that are unable to love each other.

I miss mom's voice, I miss her whistle. I miss her silly laugh, and I miss hearing her whisle while she moved her things for the hundredth time. I miss her telling me her plans to hem her clothes, and get a new sewing machine. I miss her talk about flowers and plants. I miss her doing the baby talk with tomas that Beth hated and that annoyed me. I miss her waking me up in the middle of the night because she thought tomas had gotten out of the house. I miss seeing her in her room. 

Please be safe mum. I love you!

*Thirteen by Big Star. The lyrics to this song are irrelevant to anything on this post, but the melody makes me melancholic. Quite like I am feeling now.*{:.image-caption .clearfix}
